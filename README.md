 Python Turtle Reusable Functions - This program uses the Python Turtle to draw 
 shapes using loops, functions, and recursion to draw various graphical objects: 
 
     circles, squares, lines and others, within a TurtleScreen.

 Features:
 =================================================================================
 * A border of selectable size is specified by user within which all objects
      are drawn. 
 * All objects can be created with over 16 different colors
 * THe thickness of the objects are user-selecteable within a reasonable range
 * Recursion is used to paint and then erase the archor box test objects in the
      4 screen quadrants.
      The anchor boxes prove the whitespace offset from the border is consisten. 
 * User selectable terse, intermediate or debug comments
 * User inputs are filtered and QC'd to verify numeric values are actual numerics
     and user prompted to correct
 * Lines, side by side squares, rectangles are drawn.
